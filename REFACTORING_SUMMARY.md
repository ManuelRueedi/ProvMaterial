# ArticleSearchForm Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The ArticleSearchForm.vue component has been refactored to improve code organization, maintainability, and readability.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Component Separation

- **SearchFormField.vue**: Reusable component for form fields with icon and label
- **SocketsConfiguration.vue**: Dedicated component for socket selection logic
- **SelectedSocketsList.vue**: Component to display and manage selected sockets
- **SearchResults.vue**: Component to handle search results display

### 2. Logic Separation

- **useArticleSearch.ts**: Composable for search functionality and data transformation
- **useSocketSelection.ts**: Composable for socket selection logic
- **TableItem interface**: Exported from useArticleSearch for type consistency

### 3. Styling Improvements

- Replaced custom CSS with Tailwind CSS classes
- Used Nuxt UI component styling patterns
- Maintained responsive design with Tailwind breakpoints
- Consistent spacing and layout using utility classes

### 4. Code Organization

- Removed duplicate code and interfaces
- Simplified prop passing and event handling
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved TypeScript type safety

## File Structure

```
components/
├── articles/
│   └── ArticleSearchForm.vue (main component)
├── SearchFormField.vue (reusable form field)
├── SocketsConfiguration.vue (socket selection)
├── SelectedSocketsList.vue (selected sockets display)
└── SearchResults.vue (results display)

composables/articles/
├── useArticleSearch.ts (search logic)
├── useSocketSelection.ts (socket selection logic)
├── useConfigurator.ts (existing configurator)
└── types.ts (existing types)
```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to maintain
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused across the application
3. **Testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
4. **Performance**: Better tree-shaking and component lazy loading
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear separation of concerns and consistent patterns
6. **Styling**: Consistent design system using Tailwind CSS and Nuxt UI

## Usage

The refactored ArticleSearchForm can be used exactly as before:

```vue
<ArticleSearchForm @select-article="handleArticleSelection" />
```

All functionality remains the same while providing better code organization and maintainability.
